Course Objectives:
  - Understand the basic concepts of probability, including probability spaces, random variables, probability distributions (discrete and continuous), and their properties. 
  - Apply probability theory to analyze and model random phenomena relevant to computational sciences and data science, such as error rates and algorithm performance. ● Learn the fundamentals of statistical inference, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and Bayesian inference. 
  - Apply statistical methods to make inferences about populations based on sample data. 
  - Understand the concepts of statistical significance, p-values, and Type I and Type II errors. 
  - Understand the importance of data quality and the impact of data biases on analysis results.
  - Explore the probabilistic foundations of machine learning algorithms, such as Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models, and generative adversarial networks. 
  - Understand the role of probability and statistics in tasks like classification, regression, and clustering. 
  - Understand the concept of probabilistic algorithms and their applications


Learning Outcomes:
The students should be able to
  - Incorporate data science principles to address data-dependent questions in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. 
  - Apply basic exploratory analysis to identify abnormalities in data (i.e., missing values, outliers, redundant features, etc.) 
  - Anticipate and identify ways in which sampled data may be biased 
  - Prepare data sufficient for answering a range of research questions across liberal arts disciplines. 
  - Identify instances of data leakage and apply techniques to avoid it 
  - Perform the appropriate feature transformations for processing categorical data and for making non-linear representations in linear models 
  - Identify the appropriate set of algorithms (i.e., regression vs. decision tree vs. clustering) for a given problem statement, and give an appropriate analysis of the pros/cons of each for the problem at hand 
  - Explain relevant data science theories and concepts, such as model regularization and optimization. 
  - Design and implement a project incorporating statistical and data science principles. 
  - Explore ethical implications surrounding privacy, data sharing, and algorithmic decision making for a given data science approach.
